## Next: Create Missing Control Plane Skills

**You're right** - `bolta.workspace.config` and several other control plane skills don't exist yet.

**Missing skills to create:**
- `bolta.workspace.config` - Workspace administration
- `bolta.quota.status` - Quota monitoring
- Several others in control-plane/

**Would you like me to:**
1. Create all missing control plane skill files?
2. Or focus on specific ones first?
